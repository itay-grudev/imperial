imperial
========
Imperial plays the Imperial March using the beep utility. It is really cool, especially if you enable it, early at boot.

Usage
-----

```
Usage: imperial (march|start|stop)

    imperial march - Starts playing the Imperial March
    imperial stop  - Stops playing the Imperial March
    imperial start - A more formal way of playing the Imperial March
```

Requirements
------------
Imperial heavily realies on the ```beep``` utility.

_P.S. Depending on your system configuration, beep may need elevetaed 
permissions._
```
# So use the force!
sudo imperial march
```
